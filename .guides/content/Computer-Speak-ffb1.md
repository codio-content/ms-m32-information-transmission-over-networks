As you recall, a computer represents everything in binary -- a series of 1s and 0s. Images, documents, and programs can all be broken down into these 1s and 0s.

Text is represented using Unicode or ASCII, for instance.  Each letter on the keyboard is represented by a particular value that you can look up in the [ASCII Table](http://www.asciitable.com/).
